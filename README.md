## About RGB++
RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB that utilizes disposable seals and client verification techniques to manage state changes and transaction validation. It maps Bitcoin UTXOs to Nervos CKB cells through homomorphic binding and leverages script constraints on both the CKB and Bitcoin chains to verify the correctness of state calculations and the validity of ownership transfers. RGB++ addresses the technical challenges of the original RGB protocol in real-world applications and offers additional possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client verification, transaction folding, shared state with non-custodial contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to Bitcoin without the need for cross-chain interactions and without compromising security.
