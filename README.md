## About [RGB++](https://www.rgbppfans.com/)
RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB that utilizes single-use seals and client-side verification techniques to manage state changes and transaction validation. It maps Bitcoin UTXOs to Nervos CKB cells through isomorphic binding and leverages script constraints on both the CKB and Bitcoin chains to verify the correctness of state calculations and the validity of ownership transfers.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges of the original RGB protocol in real-world applications and offers additional possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client-side verification, transaction folding, shared state across contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract scalability and performance enhancements to Bitcoin without the need for cross-chain interactions and without compromising security.
